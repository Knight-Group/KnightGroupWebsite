        <h3>Effective Date: 10/20/2024</h3>

        <p>Knight Group offers the following services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Handyman Services</strong>: We provide unlicensed handyman services strictly within Pinellas County, Florida. Services offered do not include tasks that require a professional license.</li>
            <li><strong>Programming & Database Services</strong>: Remote programming and database services are available. In some cases, projects may not be completed due to time constraints or insufficient compensation. However, accepted projects will typically be completed unless otherwise specified.</li>
            <li><strong>Handcrafted Wooden Furniture & Artistic Resins</strong>: We offer handcrafted wooden furniture and artistic resins, which can be purchased in person or ordered for shipping. Shipping arrangements are made upon acceptance of the order.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Knight Group reserves the right to refuse services or products under specific conditions, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Violation of local laws (e.g., requesting unlicensed work beyond the scope of handyman services).</li>
            <li>Inability to complete programming or coding projects due to time or financial constraints.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Payment Terms</h3>
