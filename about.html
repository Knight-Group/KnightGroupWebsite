    <!-- About Us Content -->
    <section class="page-content">
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>At Knight Group, our mission is to bring expertise and dedication to every area we operate in, from technology services to property management and furniture craftsmanship. Our goal is to offer customized, reliable services while building long-term relationships with clients and communities alike. We continuously aim to bridge the gap between quality and affordability, delivering excellence with every project we undertake.</p>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>The Knight Group began its journey in 1995, founded as a computer networking company in the heart of Safety Harbor on Main Street. Back then, we specialized in managing mainframes and servers for businesses like <strong>Ruth Eckerd Hall</strong> and the <strong>Safety Harbor Spa</strong>. Over the years, as technology evolved, so did we. Our services expanded into database management, handling SQL and SSIS for clients seeking robust data solutions.</p>

        <p>As we achieved success in the tech sector, we leveraged this growth to acquire properties throughout Pinellas County, expanding into property management. This opened a new chapter for Knight Group, where we not only manage properties but also renovate and restore them. With years of experience under our belt, we seamlessly merged our technical background with hands-on management of real estate, providing comprehensive services for both property owners and tenants.</p>

        <h2>Handyman Services</h2>
        <p>Our handyman services are driven by over 10 years of experience in the field. Our primary handyman worked as a journeyman plumber with Roto Rooter in the Pittsburgh area of Pennsylvania. Although licensed in PA, we offer a wide range of handyman and contracting work without licensing here in Florida. This includes general repairs, home improvement projects, plumbing repairs, light carpentry, drywall installation, and remodeling work. Many tasks can legally be performed without needing a license, covering a significant range of repairs and improvements, making us a one-stop solution for homeowners and property managers alike.</p>

        <h2>Programming & Database Services</h2>
        <p>Our roots in computer networking have grown into advanced programming and database management. Whether you need customized programming solutions, database design, or SQL and SSIS implementations, Knight Group has the expertise. We specialize in streamlining data workflows, automating processes, and developing custom applications tailored to your business needs. Our technology services are built on decades of experience, ensuring top-notch results for every client.</p>

        <h2>Handcrafted Wooden Furniture & Artistic Resins</h2>
        <p>In addition to our tech and property services, our retired Knights have taken up a passion for woodworking. Our team sources rare and exotic woods, crafting unique pieces of furniture that combine traditional craftsmanship with modern creativity. Using epoxy resins, we create mesmerizing designs, encasing objects within the furniture to bring them to life. Our resins are also available in a wide variety of colors, resulting in a shiny and durable finish that adds elegance to any space.</p>

        <p>Every piece is a work of art, reflecting the dedication and skill of our team. Whether it's a rustic dining table or an epoxy-encased masterpiece, our furniture stands out for its creativity and quality. This new division of the Knight Group represents the same attention to detail that has driven our success for decades in other industries.</p>
